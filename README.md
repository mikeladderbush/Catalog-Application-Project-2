This was a project I was working on to learn more about using Spring frameworks with Java and React. The main focus was to set up a static website that utilized web tokens
for security and would get and put data in and out of a mySQL database as well. There was no planned goal, it was really to just stress concepts that I had learned small bits of
in school and wanted to continue building upon until I ran out of interest.
